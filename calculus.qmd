# Calculus for Machine Learning

This section covers core calculus concepts used in machine learning — especially in optimization, backpropagation, and probability.


## Completing the Square

A general method for rewriting quadratic expressions:

$$
a x^2 - 2 b x = a \left( x - \frac{b}{a} \right)^2 - \frac{b^2}{a}
$$

This transformation is widely used in:

- Gaussian probability density derivations  
- KL divergence simplification  
- Optimization of quadratic objectives


## Derivatives

The derivative of a function measures the rate of change:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} f(x)
$$

## Partial Derivatives

Used when dealing with multivariate functions:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

## Jacobian Matrix

For a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \), the Jacobian is:

$$
J_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}
$$

## Hessian Matrix

Second-order partial derivatives:

$$
H_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}
$$

Used in curvature analysis and second-order optimization.

## Integration

Area under a curve:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$

## Integration by Parts

A useful transformation:

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$
